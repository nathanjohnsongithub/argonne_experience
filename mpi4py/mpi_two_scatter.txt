mpi_two is a more advanced implementation of mpi4py.
the program takes an empty array, fills it with zeros, 
sends a section of the array to all of the other ranks 
equally and they do some arithmetic on it and send it 
back and print it out. to run the program. 
Instead of doing some weird arithmetic this uses comm.scatter to send the array
	#
	mpirun -n <number of ranks you want> python mpi_two_scatter.py
	#
	or
	#
	mpiexec -n <number of ranks you want> python mpi_two_scatter.py
