mpi_three was my introduction to file sending and profilers in python.
it creates a file with 0-n number of lines with an integer for the line number starting from 0.
sends a section of the file and to each rank and they do something and then send it back to the master.

this creates multiple files. the file named "myfile1.txt" contains the first created file with the number of lines for the inputed number -1
the next file is "mychangedfile1.txt" that has the converted file that different parts of the program worked on
the profile will then output 2 files for each rank. a .txt and .prof file. 
the .prof file can be viewed using something called snakeviz which can be found here
https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/
you can view the .txt file like normal. the profile outputs this for each rank

to run the program type
	#
	mpirun -n <number of ranks you want> python mpi_three.py
	#
